            <h2>Gore v. Bush</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="panel1">
            <h3>
                In the 2000 Presidential Election, Vice President Al Gore took on Republican Nominee
                George W. Bush for office. Gore was the VP the 8 years prior under Bill Clinton, leading
                to an easily won primary. As for Bush, he was the Govenor of Texas the 5 years leading
                into the election, and won in the Republican Primary against Arizona Senator John McCain.
                <br><br>
                The election ended up coming down to Florida, where a slim vote margin forced a legally mandated
                recount in the state. Bush was originally projected to have had won, but these recounts
                proved to push the dial more in Gore's favor. One final recount was scheduled to take place,
                when the Bush campaign called for the halting of a recount of ballots that included some
                originally missed by the tabulation machines. This count would have likely pushed Gore over
                the edge, but the Supreme Court controversially voted 5-4 to halt this final recount, giving
                the election to Bush.
                <br><br>
                This election is still debated today, with many claiming the Al Gore would have most likely won
                the election if it were not for this decision.

            <h2>JFK v. Nixon</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="panel2">
            <h3>The 1960 Presidential Election was between Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President
                Richard Nixon of California. This election isn't very controversial in its results as JFK won the
                presidency with an 84 point Electoral College lead. the real controversy lies in the popular vote.
                <br><br>
                Some say that Richard Nixon won the popular vote based on what happened in Mississippi and,
                specifically, Alabama with some of the electorates. In this election, there was a third party candidate that some
                of the elecotrates that leaned Democratic were going to vote for no matter what. This lead to a lot of
                controversy in those states, with the arizona pollsters eventually deciding to list all 22 electorates
                (11 Republican, 5 Democratic, 6 Third Party), and having each voter vote for 11 of them. This would
                theoretically replicate what the voters usually vote for, but ended up leaving a lot of voters splitting thier votes
                between the three candidates.
                <br><br>
                In the end, JFK won 5 electoral votes from the state, with the popular vote tally not being accuratley
                reflected from the state. Because the popular vote margin between JFK and Nixon was so thin, many think that Nixon
                may have truly won the popular vote, with JFK having been falsely reported as the popular winner.

            <h2>Carter v. Ford</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="panel3">
            <h3>
                The 1976 Presidential Election was between Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter and Incumbent Republican
                President Gerald Ford of Nebraska. This election isnt incredibly controversial, but marked an impotrant turning
                point for Democrats.
                <br><br>
                Upon winning this election, Jimmy Carter became the first Democratic president to win all of the Deep
                South since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. Carter also took narrow victories in Ohio and Wisconsin, which
                helped carry his relatively slim Electoral College majority of 297 to 240. Not only that, but Carter only won
                the popular vote with 50.1% of the total tally, meaning that these two states were essential in deciding the
                election.
                <br><br>
                The previous president, Richard Nixon, was coming off of his infamous
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Watergate Scandal</a>. Him being a republican,
                and Gerald Ford having pardoned him upon taking the presidency, were most likely a factors in Ford's
                Loss.
                <br><br>
                Despite the reasons, Carter was a beam of light for Democrats who otherwise weren't able to win hold the
                office of president in the 6 elections from 1968 to 1988.
