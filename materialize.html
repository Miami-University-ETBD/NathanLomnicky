                   <h2>Jimmy Carter</h2>
                   <p>
                    The 39th President of the United States was born October 1st, 1924 and died on December 29th, 2024. 
                    During his incumbency, Carter focused heavily on domestic issues such as education, healthcare, the
                    economy, and advocacy. One of his biggest Achievements was creating the Department of Education (DOE).
                    While his presidency isn't favored by many, his post-presidency is seen as one of the greatest achievements
                    to ever come of a former Presdient. Centered heavily on foreign diplomacy, Carter saught to bring peace amongst
                    the middle east and other regions across the globe. His legacy withstands the test of time, as he will live on
                    as one of the most important figures in contemporary human history.

                    <h2>Barack Obama</h2>
                    <p>
                        Barack Obama, the 44th President, is a massively important figure in recent American history. As the country's first ever
                        president of color, to many, he marked a pivital point in history where the world was becoming a better, more inclusive
                        place for all. His achievements include stabilizing the country after a recession, the ever-transformative Affordable 
                        Care Act which expanded healthcare access to millions of uninsured Americans, and the push for more climate-knowledgable
                        policies. Obama also urged the supreme court to strengthen the rights of LGBTQ+ Americans, leading to the historic 5-4 
                        rulling of <i>Obergefell v. Hodges</i>, which federally ensured that gay marriges would be recognized by the United States.
                        This rulling is seen as one of the most important civil rights decisions since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

                <h2>John F Kennedy</h2>
                <p>
                    John Fitzgerald Kennedy, informally known as JFK, is seen as a pillar of American Pride. His namesake alone holds much power
                    in our country's political landscape, and is known for representing strong, patriotic, traditional American values. As the 35th
                    president, Kennedy oversaw highetened tensions with the USSR during the Cold War. In responce, Kennedy created the Peace Corps, 
                    as well as Launched the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and handeled an incredibly delicate Cuban Missle Crisis. Pretty much every second
                    of his presidency was defined by war, which is what eventually led to what is considered one of the greatest achievements in
                    world history: the Moon Landing. JFK would eventually be assassinated on November 22nd, 1963, when a shooter from an unspecified
                    location shot the president in the back of an open limousine in Dallas Texas. While the main suspect of the shooting was found to 
                    be Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK's death is still shrouded by question and suspicion that many theorize about to this day.
